# Something about this "leetcode" project.

## What's in this project?
This project includes particial solutions to leetcode problems.

Go back to the first time I signed in leetcode.com, there were only about 150 problems, and I told myself I would solve all these problems, but now the number has increased to 400+, and I never completed all problems.

## Language
All these solutions are written by Java.

## Why did I solve leetcode problems?
I solved these problems during the year of 2015-2016 in order to find a job and get a solid comprehension of data structrue and algorithm.

## Is it helpful for your job hunting?
Absolutly, It is very helpful, and I give a strong recommendation to everybody who eager to get a good job to solve these problems.

## Will I continue?
Yes, althought I have found a job now, but I think it can help me to remember fundamental knowledge and you know, data structrue and algorithm is the core of computer science. Also, it would be a advantage if I want to change my job to another company.

But, I don't intend to continue in this project, I will build a new project as a new start of another "leetcod stage", and it is very possible for me to change to another language.

## Attention!
I did some problems several times, so for some problems there may be different solutions with different complexity, it is good, but the side affect is that some code is mess. It will take a lot of time to clean redundancy code, so my code just gives you a reference, it is not the most optimal solution. I suggest you to find more optimal solutions in "discuss" of every problem.
